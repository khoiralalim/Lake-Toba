            <p>For the Batak ethnic group of Lake Toba in North Sumatra, - as indeed with other communities in Indonesia, - their meticulously handwoven textiles, known as “ulos” are not merely made to wear as clothing, but are significant symbols of status, serve as precious heirlooms, or are ceremonial gifts during rites in human’s life cycle from births and weddings to deaths. Traditionally, weaving was the task of women only, and men were prohibited from the work, since it is believed that while weaving, women imbue the cloth with symbolic values connected with women’s role in caring for family, children and the community. Whilst men’s duty is the protection of family and village. Therefore weaving can be done only during leisure time while women tend to home and children. It is small wonder, then, that one cloth may take months to complete.</p>
            <p>Batak textiles use mostly cotton yarn, while colors are produced by immersing the yarn in plant dye. The blue color comes from the indigo plant, red is made from sappanwood and morinda which grow abundantly in the tropics. Yellow comes from turmeric, whereas black is produced by mixing morinda with indigo, and green is a mix of indigo and turmeric. Textiles are woven on back-strap or body tension looms, where tension is created by the weight of the seated weaver who leans against the back strap.  That is the reason why this type of hand-woven cloths can only be made as wide as the arms’ span of the weaver. </p>
